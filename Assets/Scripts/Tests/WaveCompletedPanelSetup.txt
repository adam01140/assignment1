To set up the between-wave UI panel that shows statistics, follow these steps:

1. In the Hierarchy, create a new UI Canvas if one doesn't already exist
   - Right-click in Hierarchy → UI → Canvas
   - Make sure it has a Canvas Scaler component set to "Scale with Screen Size"

2. Create a Panel as a child of the Canvas
   - Right-click on Canvas → UI → Panel
   - Name it "WaveCompletedPanel"
   - Adjust its RectTransform:
     - Width: 500
     - Height: 400
     - Anchors: Middle-Center

3. Add a Title Text to the panel
   - Right-click on WaveCompletedPanel → UI → Text - TextMeshPro
   - Name it "TitleText"
   - Set Font Size to 36
   - Set Alignment to Center
   - Position it at the top of the panel
   - This will be the "Wave X Completed!" text

4. Add a Stats Text to the panel
   - Right-click on WaveCompletedPanel → UI → Text - TextMeshPro
   - Name it "StatsText"
   - Set Font Size to 24

   - This will show enemy count, time, damage dealt, etc.

5. Add a Continue Button to the panel
   - Right-click on WaveCompletedPanel → UI → Button - TextMeshPro
   - Name it "ContinueButton"
   - Set its Text to "Continue"
   - Position it at the bottom of the panel

6. Add the WaveCompletedPanel script

   - Add Component → WaveCompletedPanel
   - Assign the references:
     - Panel: The WaveCompletedPanel GameObject itself
     - Wave Info Text: The TitleText
     - Stats Text: The StatsText
     - Continue Button: The ContinueButton

7. Update the EnemySpawner reference
   - Find the EnemySpawner in your scene
   - Add a reference to your WaveCompletedPanel in the "Wave Completed Panel" field

8. Test in Play mode
   - Start a level and complete a wave
   - The panel should appear showing wave statistics
   - Click Continue to proceed to the next wave
